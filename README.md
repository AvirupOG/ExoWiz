# Getting Started
## Introduction
Humanity’s quest to understand the universe has entered a new era. Thanks to data from multiple space-based missions, thousands of planets beyond our solar system have already been discovered. Yet, most of these exoplanets were identified manually, requiring countless hours of expert analysis. With advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), we now have the tools to accelerate this search — uncovering new worlds at a pace once thought impossible.

# Choose Your Dataset
Just like exploring uncharted star systems, each dataset offers its own challenges and opportunities. NASA’s Kepler, TESS, and other survey missions provide vast amounts of stellar light curve data, where exoplanet signals hide among noise. Which dataset will you harness to train your model?

# Challenge Levels
## Level 1: Data Horizons – The First Look
Begin by exploring raw exoplanet datasets. Understand the structure of light curves, noise factors, and confirmed planetary signatures. This foundation prepares you for deeper AI exploration.

# Level 2: Model Building – Training the Explorer
Develop your AI/ML model. Experiment with algorithms — from classical classifiers to deep learning approaches — to distinguish between planetary signals and false positives.

# Level 3: Validation & Testing – The Reality Check
Put your model to the test. Apply it to unseen datasets and measure its ability to correctly identify candidate exoplanets. Learn about accuracy, precision, recall, and the importance of reducing false detections.

# Level 4: Beyond Discovery – Scaling to the Cosmos
Tackle the larger implications. How can automated AI-driven discovery reshape our understanding of the galaxy? Explore the potential for detecting Earth-like worlds and predicting habitability.

# Educational Goals
### Deepen Understanding: Learn how exoplanets are discovered and why AI is transforming astronomy.
### Hands-On Exploration: Gain practical skills in AI/ML applied to real-world astrophysical data.
### Critical Thinking: Tackle data challenges, noise filtering, and modeling trade-offs.
### Inspire Discovery: Contribute to the future of space exploration and potentially uncover new planets.

Aqua Explorer aims to make learning about the water cycle and climate change engaging and accessible for students, ultimately contributing to a more informed and environmentally conscious generation.

# Join the Mission
The universe is vast, and humanity has only just begun to map its worlds. With your skills, you can help accelerate the discovery of new exoplanets and push the boundaries of science.
Start your Exoplanet AI Challenge today — and be part of the next great leap in exploring the cosmos.
